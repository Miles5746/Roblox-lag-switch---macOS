# Roblox-lag-switch-macOS
A python lag switcher for macOS.
This is only tested on macOS Tahoe 26.1, but may work on any other macOS.

# Will you get banned for using this?
Byfron (Roblox's anti cheat) will not detect this - if you use it to teleport around the map, Roblox will just think you are lagging. However, if you abuse this in games for tasks such as shooting people, you may get banned.
